  <h1>What This Blog Is</h1>

  <p>“Hello World”, lamar here. I finally decided to start my personal blog (journal)😌. I would like to tell you
about my motivations for creating a blog and what its about.</p>

<hr data-content="The Why" />

<p>I always find myself learning about something new, reading about a new technology and then jotting down my findings’ in
notebooks that I cannot find half of the time😌, I thought, there should a better way to do this, create a blog, write
about something new I am learning about, this way, I get to have better recall for whatever I am learning at that moment
and also always have a reference to it whenever I need it, plus, some of you might find my words useful which is a
win-win situation for me.
—</p>

<hr data-content="The What" />

<p>This blog is a repository of my findings and learning as I try to grow and navigate my way around the world as an
individual, software engineer. It is a place I can get to share my thoughts around any new technologies I encounter,
situations, generally life as we know it. hopefully you might find it interesting too.</p>
