title: What This Blog Is
category: intro

"Hello World", lamar here. I finally decided to start my personal blog (journal)ðŸ˜Œ. I would like to tell you
about my motivations for creating a blog and what its about.

{: data-content="The Why"}

I always find myself learning about something new, reading about a new technology and then jotting down my findings' in
notebooks that I cannot find half of the timeðŸ˜Œ, I thought, there should a better way to do this, create a blog, write
about something new I am learning about, this way, I get to have better recall for whatever I am learning and also
always have a reference to it whenever I need it, some of you might find my words useful which is a win-win situation
for me.

{: data-content="The What"}

This blog is a repository of my findings and learning as I try to grow and navigate my way around the world as an
individual, software engineer. It is a place I can get to share my thoughts around any new technologies I encounter,
situations, generally life as we know it. hopefully you might find it interesting too.
